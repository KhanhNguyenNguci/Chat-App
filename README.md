## Application Description
1. The application allows two or more users on different machines to chat with each other.
2. The chat client is built on the hybrid model between the Client-Server and P2P models. The system has a central server for user registration and online user management, but clients chat directly with each other. (Students can refer to Napster for an illustration).
3. One person has a list of friends retrieved from the central server. He/she can start some chats with different people at the same time. Each conversation is a P2P connection.
4. Application allows file transfer during chats between clients through P2P connection. 
5. The application must use communication protocols already pre-defined by each group.
